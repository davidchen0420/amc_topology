As a group they face persistent gaps in treatment because many jails and prisons don’t provide medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) nor support detainees in finding health insurance or treatment after their release. As a result, people leaving jails and prisons are at higher risk of overdose than the general population; one study found North Carolina inmates were 40 times more likely to die of an overdose within two weeks of release than other state residents.","579","index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1","","","https://forefdn.org/expanding-access-to-oud-treatment-before-during-and-after-incarceration-opportunities-for-policy-and-practice/","","","","","","32323","1007","21.975","4","","10","4","2.960","23","15","15","11","","","","","76ac15d9848299d186e4ed2dd3cbcc63","0.568","","","","","HTTP/1.1","https://forefdn.org/expanding-access-to-oud-treatment-before-during-and-after-incarceration-opportunities-for-policy-and-practice/","2021-09-11 18:18:45"
